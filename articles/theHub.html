      <h1>Mental and Sexual Health</h1>

      <h2>It&#39;s time to be open about sexual and mental health.</h2>
      <p>
        <br>
        Health is a topic that isn&#39;t widely discussed but most definitely should be especially within our school. All aspects of health are important, including sexual and mental health.
        The question is: do teenagers have the knowledge required to take care of their health? Do teenagers know who to ask for personal advice?<br><br>
      </p>
      <h2>How to get help when it comes to sexual health.</h2>
      <p>
        <br>
        The Hub is a free, walk in health clinic which provides aid for people all over Fife through a number of local clinics.
        The clinics are a safe space for youths to openly discuss both their mental and sexual health with a number of experienced nurses who can cater to anyone with their knowledge and support.
        Confidentiality is key at the Hub which enables the youth to feel safe and at ease when enquiring and receiving aid.
        The clinic provides aid on a number of topics which many teenagers are either curious about or struggling with.
        The wide range of topics include relationships, pressures of school, bullying, contraception, sexually transmitted diseases, teenage pregnancy, puberty, LQBT, Drugs, and sex.
        Among women aged 16-49, the lowest levels of contraceptive use are found in the 16-19 year olds.
        Two thirds of heterosexual 16-19 year olds are &#39;at risk&#39; of pregnancy, but approximately one in ten of those with a partner does not use contraception.
        The nurses on duty at the Hub can provide teenagers with both condoms and pregnancy tests giving them both the knowledge and implications of sex.
        As teenagers we need to be open to the ideology of our sexual health and the fact it is okay to ask for help.
        If struggling with your sexual health you can always receive help from doctors, guidance teachers, and parents.
        There is always someone to help, you just have to ask.

      <h2>How to recieve help for mental health.</h2>
      <p>

        10% of school children aged between 5 and 16 will have a diagnosable mental illness,
        many students aren&#39;t aware of the support on offer to help them through there ill health.
        Like sexual health students can always rely on their guidance teachers and doctors for aid.
        But there are many other ways to get help. 50% of mental health problems are established by age 14 so it is vital for teenagers to be aware of mental health in high school.
        They can do this through websites such as Young Minds where students are able to find out information on mental health conditions which can help to find further information on the site to help them reach out and receive help.
        Young Minds provides a symptom list to potentially help the individual identify their mental illness.
        There is support provided on the site for both those suffering and the parents.
        This allows parents to gain knowledge on mental health and enables them to aid their child fully.
