        The Welcome Walk
      </h1>

        <br><br>
        On Tuesday 5th of September every pupil and member of staff took part in the third Welcome Walk.
        We walked 5km around the Beveridge Park to raise money for Welcome Primary in Cape Town, South Africa.
        To raise funds pupils were given sponsor sheets and are encouraged to get sponsorships from friends and families.
        <br><br>
        The money is having a massive impact on Welcome Primary, and will go towards employing teachers, buying school supplies and developing the school.
        Over the last two Welcome Walks we have raised a sum of £24,000 and has been spent on hiring two librarians and two sport coaches who work in Welcome Primary daily. It has also contributed to improving the building.
        <br><br>
        All pupils were encouraged to dress up in costumes or wear the colours of the South African flag. This year we raised over £8,500 for Welcome Primary, making the total over the last three walks more than £30,000.
        Pupils from Balwearie have also travelled to Cape Town this October to learn about the country and the culture and to see how the money we raised has affected the school.
        Speak to Mr McGuckin or an S6 who went there to find out more about the trip!
