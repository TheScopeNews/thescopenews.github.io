# Mr McNeil Article.

When I was asked to interview Mr McNeil, I was slightly sceptical about doing so. I’d heard rumours that he was very strict and wasn’t the easiest person to get along with. Nothing could be further from the truth…
We met on a Monday lunchtime in his office, and he was more than happy to discuss his career with me.
He started his story by telling me about his time at school. His Technology teacher suggested to him he should consider a career in teaching. He ignored this advice, and decided to study to become a Civil Engineer. Whilst working in that profession he was offered a job in the Middle East, but declined the offer as he didn’t want to leave the country.
He remembered the conversation with his 'techy' teacher and decided in 1985 that maybe it wasn’t such a bad idea at all to train as a teacher.
After graduating as a Maths teacher his first post was at Auchmuty High in Glenrothes. He then moved to the school he is in today (Balwearie) and taught Maths for 5 years. He was then promoted to a Depute Rector position at Beath High, followed by another Depute job at Queen Anne High in Dunfermline.
His final post before Balwearie was the post of Rector at Glenwood High School Glenrothes.
Since his return to the school in 2017, he has been impressed with pupil’s academic achievements and how the school has progressed since he last taught here.
On returning to the school after the summer break, Mr McNeil is conducting “pick n mix” meetings, where he invites pupils to come and meet him and discuss ideas for improving the
school. . He believes this is a good way to get pupils views of the school.
I’m sure the positive impact of the Head Teacher’s leadership will promote and sustain improvement of Balwearie High school.
